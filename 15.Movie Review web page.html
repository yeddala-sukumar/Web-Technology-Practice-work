    <h3>Synopsis</h3>
    <p style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;">Dunki's story is an emotional one - rolling in friendship, romance, heart-wrenching and heart-warming moments all into one. And in trademark Hirani style, there are dollops of comedy which is laced with satire to make it an entertaining ride, along with the strong message the film brings forth.</p>
    <h3>Story</h3>
    <p style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;">A soldier, Hardayal Singh Dhillon (Shah Rukh Khan) takes on an arduous and audacious mission, of helping a group of friends realise their dream of going to England. It seems like an impossible task because neither do they have a visa or nor can they can afford a ticket.
         It is the start of a journey that promises to change all their lives forever.</p>
    <h3>Review</h3>
    <p style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;">When an ailing Manu (Taapsee Pannu) wants to return to India, she realises Hardayal Singh Dhillon aka Hardy is the only one who can help her come back to the country she left yebrars back in search of better prospects.</p>
    <p style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;">Twenty-five years ago, Hardy arrived in Laltu, a remote village in Punjab in search of someone who had saved his life. Instead, he encountered a group of friends, Manu (Taapsee Pannu), Buggu (Vikram Kochchar) and Balli (Anil Grover), whose sole mission was to make it to the UK, in search of a better life. The committed three try everything to secure an immigration visa - from learning wrestling to fake marriages and degrees, falling prey to scams along the way. Finally, they decide to learn English in the hope of securing a student visa. It is here that they meet Sukhi (Vicky Kaushal), who is desperate to make it to London for his own reasons. "Birmingham here I come" becomes their motto.</p>
    <p style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;"">But despite all their efforts when the visa is denied to them, things go very awry. Heartbroken by the turn of events, Hardy takes it upon himself to make a passage for his new-found friends to reach the foreign shores they so desperately want to. They make the hard decision to take the 'donkey' ('Dunki') route - a way for illegal immigrants to make their way. It's a tumultuous journey riddled with hardships and challenges.</p>
